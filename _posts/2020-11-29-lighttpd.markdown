# Lighttpd config

- *max-proc*: the number of fastcgi processes that will be started (default: 4)
- *socket*: path to the unix-domain socket

```
fastcgi.server = (
    "/osc/" => ((
        "check-local" => "disable",
        "socket" => "/tmp/fastcgi.socket",
        "bin-path" => "/usr/local/sbin/osccmd.cgi",
        "max-procs" => 2
    ))
)
```

# Single-threaded FCGI

For signal thread FCGI, we can use [FCGI_Accept][fcgi_accept] to accept new request from HTTP server. Since we shall include [fcgi_stdio.h][fcgi_stdio], all standard I/O function will be redirected to FCGI-based I/O functions. The environment strings can be also searched by **getenv**.


Example:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JasperHsieh0415/55d652869ad10e24bfe8c50470ebf742.js"></script>

# Multi-threaded FCGI

For multi thread FCGI, we can use FCGX_Accept_r to accept requests from HTTP server. Detail steps as follows:

1. Initialize FCGX library: [FCGX_Init][fcgx_init]
2. Loop for accepting request: [FCGX_Accept_r][fcgx_appect_r]
3. Get parameters from requests: [FCGX_GetParam][fcgx_param]
4. Send response to the client: [FCGX_FPrintF][fcgx_fprintf]
